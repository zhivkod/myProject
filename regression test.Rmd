```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

importing my data

```{r}
claims <- read.csv('data/claims.csv')
```

loading dplyr

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

i want to convert my data to a tbl so i can start exploring it

```{r}
tbl_df(claims)
glimpse(claims)
```

for the purposes of my study  i am only interested in a few of these columns, so i will clean up my dataset to remove all data i do not need:

```{r}
claims <- select(claims, State, Claim.Reason, Claim.Amount )
glimpse(claims)
```

i now want to summarize the number of cases of hail claims per state, their sums and their means

```{r}
claims %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  filter(Claim.Reason=="Hail") %>%
  summarise(count=n(), SumAllClaims=sum(Claim.Amount), MeanClaim=mean(Claim.Amount))
```
